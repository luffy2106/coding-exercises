# K means
#
# Write a k-means function that takes data points and a number of centroids K and return the centroids. Data points belong to an n dimensional space (arbitrary n).
#
# Initialization: initialize the K centroidsÂ 
# Iterate the two following steps until a certain criterion is met
#    Assignment: Assign each point to the closest centroid
#    Update: update the centroids to be the average of all the points that were assigned to it.
