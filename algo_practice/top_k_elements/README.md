# Top-K elements pattern

The Top K Frequent Elements problem involves finding the K most frequent elements in a given dataset. It is a useful problem for data analysis and can be used to identify trends in data. Solutions to this problem include advanced techniques such as implementing a heap or quickselect, making it a useful problem for testing a broad range of sorting approaches and their complexity tradeoffs.

You need to review Heap, priority queue and Quick Select to implement the solution in the optimized way. Heap is important data structure if you want to find top K element without using sorting algorithm because it's more optimized:
1. Heap 
- Build heap from array take O(n)
- Add/delete element to/from heap take O(log(n))
- Find the max/min in heap take O(1)
2. Sorting
Sorting take at least O(n log n)
