The two-heap algorithm, often used to solve problems related to finding the median of a data stream, is beneficial in scenarios where you need to efficiently manage and access the median of a dynamically changing set of numbers. Here's a detailed explanation of when and how to use this algorithm:

When to Use the Two-Heap Algorithm
- Real-Time Median Calculation: If you need to maintain and frequently query the median of a growing list of numbers in real-time, the two-heap algorithm is highly efficient.
- Dynamic Data Sets: When the data set is not static and new elements are continuously added, and you need to know the median at any point, this algorithm provides an optimal solution.
- Performance Requirements: For applications where performance is critical, and you need to ensure that median calculations are done in logarithmic time complexity, the two-heap algorithm is ideal.
