#### 1. What is the four basic concepts of OOP:
- encapsulation : This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data
- abstraction : abstract class contain abstract method(which has declaration but no implementation), Their implementation will be declared by sub class.
