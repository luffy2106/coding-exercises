1. Before start coding, make sure you understand the question. If you have live coding, ask the interviewer provide example output and make sure you understand the output of the question before doing anything else.
2. Spend time to brain storm first before start coding. It will save a lof of time for debugging.
3. Alway thinks the solution should be simple, otherwise move to another question, or take a look at the solution if you are practicing
4. write clean code.
5. Pay attention to the logic of each line while you write the code. it will save a lot of time for debugging.
6. Be less dependent to the debug mode, you can not use it in the real test. 
7. If you are applied for DS/ML engineer position, you need to focus on these patterns(this is the most popular one for this role)
- Arrays
- String
- Dictionaries
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion
- DFS 
- BFS
- Sliding window +two pointer
- Binary Search (pay attention to the edge left and right, check git note)
8. Master 4 patterns could help you solve 80% of leetcode problems
- DFS 
- BFS
- Sliding window +two pointer
- Binary Search (pay attention to the edge left and right, check git note)
